## Tips and Tricks, and other useful information

### 1. How to use custom fonts in React Native

#### Custom Fonts - Android

To use custom fonts in Android specific code, you need to add in folder `Android` a folder `assets` and inside add other fold `fonts` and put your fonts there. After that, you need run the command `npm run android` or `yarn android` to generate the fonts in the Android project.

#### Custom Fonts - iOS

To use custom fonts in iOS specific code, you need to go to the folder `ios` in the project and open the file `YourApp.xworkspace` in Xcode. After that, you need to go to the folder `YourApp` what is in side of the folder with the same name of your project `YourApp` and after that create a `New Group` with name `fonts` and put your fonts there. After that, you go to file `info` and then add a new row and select the option `Fonts provided by application` and add the name of your fonts there.
Is necessary to write the name of the fonts with the extension, for example: `Roboto-Regular.ttf`.
After that, you need run the command `npm run ios` or `yarn ios` to generate the fonts in the iOS project.

obs: to run the command `npm run ios` or `yarn ios` you need to have the Xcode installed in your machine and have a Mac OS.

You can go directly to the file `info.plist` inside of folders `ios/YourApp` and add fonts there, with the following code:

```xml
<key>UIAppFonts</key>
<array>
  <string>Roboto-Regular.ttf</string>
  <string>Roboto-Bold.ttf</string>
  <string>Roboto-Italic.ttf</string>
  <string>Roboto-BoldItalic.ttf</string>
</array>
```

This option too need to run the command `npm run ios` or `yarn ios` to generate the fonts in the iOS project.

### 2. Using Restyle for Theme and UI components

To use Babel Plugin Module Resolver, you need to create a file `babel.config.js` in the root of your project and add the following code:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
  //♂ add this code  ♂
  plugins: [
    [
      'module-resolver',
      {
        root: '.',
        alias: {
          '@components': './src/components',
          '@screens': './src/screens',
          '@routes': './src/routes',
          '@assets': './src/assets',
          '@utils': './src/utils',
          '@services': './src/services',
          '@contexts': './src/contexts',
          '@hooks': './src/hooks',
          '@styles': './src/styles',

        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

And in your `tsconfig.json` file, you need to add the following code:

```json
{
  "extends": "@tsconfig/react-native/tsconfig.json",
  //♂ add this code  ♂
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "paths": {
      // If you want all files to be imported from the root of the project, you can use the following code:
      "@components/*": ["src/components/*"],
      "@screens/*": ["src/screens/*"],
      "@routes/*": ["src/routes/*"],
      ... // and more
      // If you want to import files from a specific folder, you can use the following code:
      "@components": ["src/components"],
      "@screens": ["src/screens"],
      "@routes": ["src/routes"],
    }
  }
}
```

After this, you can import your files using the aliases, for example:

        name="name"
        control={control}
        placeholder="Name"

const Button = () => {
  return (
    <View>
